# TLV Codec Implementation Plan

## Overview  
The TLV (Type-Length-Value) codec will be responsible for encoding and decoding data in a way that allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring compatibility with various systems.

## Phases  
### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering  
- Identify the types of data to be encoded.  
- Define the structure of the TLV format.

### Phase 2: Design  
- Create a detailed design specification for encoding and decoding processes.  
- Determine error handling mechanisms.

### Phase 3: Development  
- Implement the TLV encoder.  
- Implement the TLV decoder.

### Phase 4: Testing  
- Develop unit tests for encoder and decoder.  
- Conduct integration testing with other system components.

### Phase 5: Documentation  
- Write user documentation.  
- Create technical documentation for future development.

## Timeline  
Expected completion of the TLV Codec is by the end of Q2 2026.
